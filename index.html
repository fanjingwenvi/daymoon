      <h1>Daymoon</h1>
      <p>
        Daymoon comes from those rare moments when you see the moon shining in the daytime — simple, quiet, and a little magical. This is where I put the thoughts I'm exploring, the things I'm working on, and the moments I would like to remember. I hope that, I can grow a little myself in sharing them, and it may be helpful to others.
